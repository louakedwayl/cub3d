# Introduction
Cub3D is a project that consists of creating a simple 3D engine using the raycasting technique.
The goal is to simulate a 3D environment from a 2D map, allowing the player to navigate and explore the space. This project helps develop skills in C programming, memory management, and the fundamentals of computer graphics.
